# CNN-TransferLearning
Here, we would see, how to use transfer learning for image classifications in Keras. For a brief introduction to transfer learning visit "https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/08/10-advanced-deep-learning-architectures-data-scientists/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=comprehensive-popular-deep-learning-interview-questions-answers"
We have used the following models;
1. Resnet50
2. InceptionV3
